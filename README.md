## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile Methodologies
Advantages
 -Flexibility and Adaptability: It allows for changes hence evlving requirements.
 -Continuous Improvement: Regular feedback iteraton gives room for continued refinement

Disadvantages
-Less Predictability: Its accomodation for continous charge and iterations makes timeline and budget less predictable
-Documentation Challenges: There is usually record gap as it prioritizes a working softare over comprhensive document.


Waterfall Methodogies
Advantages
-Structured Approach: It is easy to manage as it follows a linear and sequential process
-Predictability: The timeline and budget is better predicted.

Disadvantages
-Predictability Assumption: It assume that all requirement are gotten upfront, whwich is not at most time realistic.
-Late Testing: Testing is do at the end of the process which may make significant errors to be detected late.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
  Agile is more beneficial where the product need series of users feedback and refinement for its completion e.g. web development, software development, e-commerce website
  Waterfall is more beneficial where the product built or project is to be done based on established documentation with strict adherence e.g. Construction projects(like bridges and building), manufacturing.
